# Machine Learning Practice Projects
This repository contains the code I've written while self-studying machine learning. Some materials come from UCI CS178 course as well as some online courses.

Please do not use my code for any purposes, especially if you are currently taking CS178. Just browsing my code would be considered cheating. Also, I did not take the course - I studied it myself; therefore, none of my work was graded or validated by the professor or anyone else.
