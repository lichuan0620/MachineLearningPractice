# Machine Learning Practice Projects
This repository contains the code I've written while self-studying machine learning. 

Some materials that are used here come from UCI CS178 course. Current CS178 students: please do not use my code for any purposes, especially if you are currently taking CS178. Just browsing my code would be considered cheating. Also, I did not take the course - I studied it myself; therefore, none of my work was graded or validated by the professor or anyone else.
